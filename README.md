# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am a 43 year old mother. I have two kids still at home and one that is already out on his own. I am working towards becoming a Business Intelligence Analyst. I like to read, fish, camping, swimming, and hanging out with family and friends.
